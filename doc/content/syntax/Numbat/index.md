# Numbat actions

Numbat provides handy actions which automatically add all of the variables, kernels, etc
so that they don't have to be included manually each time. This can significantly reduce the
effort involved in writing a new input file, and also eliminates the possibility of input
file errors due to incorrect parameters.

!syntax list /Numbat
