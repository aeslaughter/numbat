# NumbatRayleighNumber

!syntax description /Postprocessors/NumbatRayleighNumber

A Postprocessor that calculates the Rayleigh number of the flow
\begin{equation}
Ra = \frac{k \Delta \rho g H}{\phi \mu D},
\end{equation}
where $k$ is the permeability in the flow direction, $\Delta \rho$ is the density contrast between the unsaturated and saturated fluids, $g$ is gravity, $H$ is the height of the mesh in the flow direction, $\phi$ is the porosity, $\mu$ is the fluid viscosity, and $D$ is the diffusion coefficient.
