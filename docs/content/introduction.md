# Introduction

Convective mixing of fluids in porous media is a physical process that manifests in complex flow patterns. In solutal convective mixing, the presence of a fluid component in the background fluid results in a density contrast between fluid containing the solute and fluid without. This density difference gives rise to a pressure gradient which drives motion.

Recently, a significant body of scientific literature has been concerned with density-driven convective mixing in porous media due to its applicability to geological storage of carbon dioxide, see \citet{emami-meybodi2015} for an extensive literature review. In the case where CO$_2$ is injected into a saline aquifer with a bounding cap rock, buoyancy drives vertical migration of the mobile CO$_2$ (CO$_2$ in the supercritical gas phase), which then spreads beneath the cap rock to form a thin, laterally extensive plume. In time, the gaseous CO$_2$ begins to dissolve into the local formation water, leading to a small increase in density of the saturated brine at the top of the aquifer of approximately $1\%$. Diffusion of the dissolved CO$_2$ allows further dissolution, a process that leads to a gravitational instability whereby a denser fluid lies atop a less dense one. After a sufficient period of time, vertical fluid motion is induced as vertical acceleration overcomes diffusion, and CO$_2$-rich water descends to the lower part of the reservoir.

The process of convective mixing can significantly increase the rate of dissolution of CO$_2$ in the formation water and hence reduce the amount of mobile CO$_2$. This can significantly reduce the risk of leakage into overlying aquifers, increasing the security of storage.
