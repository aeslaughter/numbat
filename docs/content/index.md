      Numbat is an open source <a href = http://www.mooseframework.com>MOOSE</a> application for high-resolution simulations of buoyancy-driven convection in porous media in both two and three dimensions. It solves the coupled convection-diffusion and Darcy equations with the Boussinesq approximation using the finite element method.

      Several formulations are available: from the full, dimensional governing equations, to a dimensionless streamfunction formulation.
      <br><br>
      As a MOOSE app, it provides access to powerful MOOSE features such as adaptive mesh refinement, hybrid parallelism, both continuous and discontinuous Galerkin methods, and much more, all wrapped in a simple interface.
