Numbat is an open source [MOOSE] application for high-resolution simulations of buoyancy-driven convection in porous media in both two and three dimensions.

As a MOOSE app, it provides access to powerful MOOSE features such as adaptive mesh refinement, hybrid parallelism, both continuous and discontinuous Galerkin methods, and much more, all wrapped in a simple interface.

!col! class=s12 m6 l6
Numat solves the coupled convection-diffusion and Darcy equations with the Boussinesq approximation using the finite element method.

Several formulations are available: from the full, dimensional governing equations, to a dimensionless streamfunction formulation.
