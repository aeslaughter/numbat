Numbat documentation:

######################
Software requirements:
 - mkdocs (www.mkdocs.org)
 - pandoc (www.pandoc.org)
 - pdflatex

######################
Extensions:

To get captions in mkdocs, we use the Python Markdown extension
figureAltCaption (github.com.jdittrich.figureAltCaption).
This needs to be installed manually by copying the figureAltCaption.py file
to the appropriate site-packages directory.

This can be found by starting python (make sure it is the correct executable used
by mkdocs for systems with multiple python installations) and typing:

import site; site-getsitepackages()

at the Python prompt. The second directory listed in the one where you should copy
figureAltCaption.py. You can check that it worked by using

import figureAltCaption

from the Python prompt.

######################
Source files:

The Numbat documentation is written in markdown and is located in the
numbat/documentation/docs directory in the master branch. Each page is a
seperate markdown file.

To allow the online documentation navigation to be built, the mkdocs.yml
file in the numbat/documentation directory must be edited to include the
name of the new page.

######################
Building the online documentation:

- To build a local version for testing:
From the numbat/documentation directory, run

mkdocs serve

and preview the documentation in a web browser

- To build and deploy the documentation to GitHub.com:
From the numbat/documentation direcotry, run

mkdocs gh-deploy --clean

which builds the documentation, transfers it the gh-pages branch,
and pushes it to GitHub. Once this has run, the updated documentation should
be available at http://cpgr.github.io/numbat
